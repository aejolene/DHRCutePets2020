title: 08 Chairman Meow the Meowser
caption: Poor Chairman Meow. This meowser, who is not a cat, is seen here wearing her dragon costume and  waiting by the door to be let outside. But nobody will let her out because she may use her little red dragon wings to fly away. This means Chairman Meow won't get to terrorize the neighbor's dogs today. Too bad. Sucks to be her. Maybe she will get a chance to be happy again if you give her all of your votes.
entrant: Ivy Tan (Richmond Animal Welfare Foundation)
