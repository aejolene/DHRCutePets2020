title: 10 I Wuv U
caption: My name is Magnolia.  But, everyone calls me Maggie.  Rod Stewart fans call me Maggie May.  For some reason, whenever I settle into a nap, they start singing at me to "Wake up Maggie."  Very annoying!  When you come to visit me I will bring you all of my special toys and we can play fetch.  If you sit in one of my favorite chairs, I will climb up on the back, sit on your shoulder and give you kisses on your ear.  I do Wuv U!
