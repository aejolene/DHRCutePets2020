title: '10 Chesapeake "Chessie" Richardson'
caption: Chessie is a two-year-old Golden Retriever who hails from the Northern Neck (hence his full name Chesapeake) and is brother to one of last year's winners, Sadie. Beneath those soulful brown eyes lies a very anxious dog who wants for nothing more than human companionship and validation (and maybe a little leaf pile surfing!). While he appears very serious in this photo, he is always quick with smiles and kisses - all of which Chessie will be happy to give you if you vote for him!  Photo courtesy of his big (human) sister, Lelia.
