title: Scary Movie (Rosie)
caption: You know that feeling when a jump scene is coming in a scary movie and you don't want to be scared, but you also don't want to miss anything? Rosie does. I got Rosie at the height of the Covid pandemic. Shelters were operating but shut down to visitors and so were full to the max across Oklahoma. When a no kill shelter near me hosted an outdoor adoption, I took Luna to find her a friend. Upon meeting, Luna and Rosie were instantly the best of friends, and I knew Rosie was coming home with us. When I told the shelter manager that I wanted Rosie, a look of disbelieve came over her face and she began to cry. She told me that even though they were a no kill shelter, extenuating circumstance of the pandemic had forced them to reluctantly adopt a euthanization schedule. She said Rosie was the sweetest dog they had, but the longest unadopted pup at the shelter and she was scheduled to be put down the next day. The manager was so excited she waved the adoption fee, gave us a crate, a new dog bed, and a 30lb bad of food. I like to think Luna saved Rosie and I think Rosie knows it.
