title: 11 Myko
caption: My name is a Navajo derivation of the word for wolf.  However, I am more like a big teddy bear!  Don't you think my blue eyes are irresistible!  They keep telling me that I am 7 years old, but I think I am still a puppy and run with endless energy.  I am super smart.  I can pick your favorite ball cap out of a whole stack of caps and chew only on that one.  I do like a little mischief now and then - don't leave your electronic remotes where I can get them!  Please be sympathetic and forgiving when I am bad - you know I have epilepsy and have to take 13 pills a day.  Yet, I live each day with gusto!  I would appreciate your vote!!
