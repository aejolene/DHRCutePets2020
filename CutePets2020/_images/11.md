title: 11 Dishwasher Dog
caption: So, I have a bad habit of eating mushrooms in my yard and on the side of the road...anywhere really. And because of that my owners have had to spend about a billion dollars in vet bills. Now, I am on a special diet with supplements, probiotics, clay powder and sometimes acupuncture because I ruined my GI tract with the toxic mushrooms. Something about helping my gut microbiome. The only treats I get are apple slices and I have lost like 8 pounds. I am always hungry. When no one is looking, I try to lick the dishes in the dishwasher. My mom looks the other way, but my dad gets upset. I try to do it quickly when no one is looking. But I have to admit the bits of food off the dishes are nothing compared to the mushrooms. If I win, maybe it could help pay for me to go to a doggie mushroom detox center?
