title: '04 Lettuce Mayonnaise (aka Lettie May)'
caption: 'Lettuce Mayonnaise (affectionately known to her friends and enemies as Lettie) is a crazy goofball of fur and fun. Her throne of choice is her cardboard couch, from which she rules as a not-so-benevolent dictator of her domain. She frequently demands cuddles, specifically while seated on top of her owners. Likes include boxes of all shapes and sizes, coffee, Cheez-its, and drowning her toy in her water bowl then plopping it on top of peoples heads at 2am. Dislikes include smoke alarms, phones, being left alone for too long, people not giving her all the attention she deserves, and being told she can't drink peoples coffee because it makes her crazy.'
entrant: 'Jennifer Bellville-Marrion (SPCA - Charlottesville-Albemarle)'
