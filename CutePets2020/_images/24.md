title: June
caption: Meet June! As a young hunting dog, June fell into a sinkhole while running with her pack. Campers miles away heard her baying for two days before they could locate and rescue her. Dry your eyes, for June now lives a life of ease and comfort surrounded by toys and showered with treats. Submitted by Blake McDonald.
