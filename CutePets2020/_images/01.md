title: Bunz
caption: This is Basil, but we just call her Bunz.  In this image she is about to jump out of her cage after using her litter box.  She is SO good about that!  She loves to race through the house at top speed, then flop down on an air conditioning vent to cool off.   Loves potato chips, but they bother her stomach, so is happy with carrots, leafy greens, apples and blueberries.  Very cuddly, but when annoyed thumps her back foot at you.  Mischievous acts include eating house plants and chewing on computer cords and baseboards.  Bunz wants to be friends with all the cats she meets but they are afraid of her.  How could anything be afraid of something so cute.  Bunz appreciates your vote!! Submitted by Elizabeth Lipford. Charity of Choice: Undesignated
