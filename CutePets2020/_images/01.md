title: '01 Toby: A Dog for all Seasons'
caption: 'Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays this dog from the swift completion of his appointed rounds. Mostly husky and lab, Toby also has the genes of GSD and the most noble and brave line of Chihuahuas south Texas has ever known. Toby loves adults, children, other dogs, and especially YOU.'
