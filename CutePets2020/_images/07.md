title: 07 Merry Christmas
caption: Sylvester was found in a box on the side of the road with all his siblings in 2020 and made his way to the Andrews home the same day.  He was only a couple of days old and barely had his eyes opened.  Now he is the alpha cat in the house, thinks he's human sometimes, gets away with things the others don't (last cat syndrome) and loves to pose for pictures.
entrant: Jennifer Andrews
