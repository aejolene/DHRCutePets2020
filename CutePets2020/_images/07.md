title: Winter Is Coming (Luna)
caption: Returning from a trip to Colorado, I was driving through the middle of the vast Osage reservation at about 2am when two eyes reflected in the distance. I didn't think much of them as I rapidly approached. Probably a racoon or opossum, I thought. But as I got closer the eyes seemed to move to the middle of my path and toward me, as if to meet me. I slowed the vehicle to a crawl and the reflecting eyes rapidly closed the distance between us. It was a tiny, white dog. A puppy! Stopping the vehicle, I turned to my sleeping brother, giving him a whack on the chest and said, "open the door." Daisied and confused, he opened the passenger side door and in jumped the most innocent little puppy. No telling how long she had been roaming this isolated section of the rez. I couldn't help but wonder how she came to be so far out in the rez. A few more hours and she would have been coyote dinner, no doubt. She had a bloody paw and seemed exhausted. She crawled up in my brother's lap and went to sleep. Figuring I'd take her to a shelter in the morning, I took her home. It only took me a few hours the next morning to realize that she was stone deaf. Somebody probably dumped her out on the rez, not wanting to deal with a deaf puppy. Well, needless to say, she stole my heart. Finding her in the middle of the night, I could think of no better name than Luna, my little rez dog.
