title: 'Myko (Navajo for wolf)'
caption: I'm back.  I survived another year of epilepsy and every tick bite disease known to humankind.  This will be my last entry.  I'm leaving the wonderful and nurturing home of my mee-maw and moving to hot Texas with her daughter and hubby.  I suppose they are my official owners.  But who takes a Husky to Texas?  Right now I am loving this cold RVA weather!  Although I take 13 pills a day for my epilepsy, I am still full of spunk and mischief.  My favorite thing to do is to see how far I can unroll the toilet paper before you discover me.  I will eat dog food, but I prefer the fresh veggie scraps in the compost pile. Winning this contest would be a great send-off gift for me and bring joy to my mee-maw who is going to be broken-hearted when I leave.
