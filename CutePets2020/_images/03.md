title: '03 Enjoying Retirement!'
caption: After many years of competition and unrealized dreams of cuteness, Henry has decided to sit this one out and enjoy a life of leisure, relaxing on the couch and watching cat videos.  I'll say that he seems a little sad not to have ever been named "DHR's Cutest!", but he's a "tough" pittie from the streets of Richmond and would never admit that he has a soft side.  Could this year be different??
