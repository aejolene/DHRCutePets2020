title: 06 Sad Henry
caption: Despite my efforts to cheer him up, Henry has been depressed since last year's competition.  He says he doesn't care about losing... year after year... and that such exploits in vanity are better left to younger and fluffier cousins, but it just breaks my heart to see him like this.  He needs your support now!!!  Before it's too late ...
