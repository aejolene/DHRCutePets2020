title: 06 Rocky Balboa
caption: Rocky is a fighter. On December 18, 2018, four Maltipoo pups were born prematurely in Long Island, NY, and taken to a local animal hospital/vet's office for care and overnight stay. During the night, the animal hospital did not turn on the heat in the room where the pups were staying. All were dead the next morning except for Rocky, who happened to be the runt of the litter. Rocky's family and friends considered suing the facility that allowed this to happen, but plans fell through and they ultimately did not pursue legal action. Rocky now spends his days entertaining his family (including big human sister Ivy when she visits from Virginia), getting his meals specially prepped by his human mom whilst avoiding any dog food, going on long walks with his human auntie and brothers, and serving as a best friend to his human dad. It's safe to say that Rocky has come a long way.
