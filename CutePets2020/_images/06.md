title: 06 Two retired racers
caption: My two children, pumpkin and peanut! They were both racing greyhounds in Florida and West VA respectively and are enjoying their lazy retirement here in RVA. We rescued them from an agency called James River Greyhound! Pumpkin is 9 years old and Peanut is 6; they both retired at 3 years old and we have had them ever since. Their favorite activities include laying down, eating, and laying down some more.
