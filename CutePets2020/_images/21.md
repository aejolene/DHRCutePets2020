title: Ellie
caption: Ellie is a sweet grouch who is both over confident and very clumsy. She loves to supervise a WFH day but only if she can stand on all the papers you need. She is unfazed by thunder but terrified every time the freezer makes ice. Lest you think she has always lived in the lap of luxury, she reportedly spent a week outside in the snow in Upstate New York before she came to live with us and every winter I am convinced she has not forgotten that fact.
