title: "I'm told I look like Jimmy Durante????"
caption: Who's that you ask! Me too. I never get his pop culture references before 2017. He says I'm just like his staff, except for Quatro. They think I like to eat carrots, which I do, but it not 'cuz they sorta look like cigars. In this case I'm using one to poke "old what's his name" in his stomach (which, let's face it, is getting pretty hard to miss) in order to get him to take me on a walk and maybe drop a pound or ten. Good night Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are. Submitted by Jim Hare.
