title: 17 Freddy
caption: Freddy is our "little" rescue. He's just an old man living out his best days since he was found starving and abandoned. He often is overlooked because of his pretty "little" sister who steals all of the attention. He doesn't mind the attention that Minnie gets, she doesn't know any better. He's mostly just happy to have a warm couch to sleep on with a full belly. Let's vote for Freddy to show this old man that rescues really are the best!
entrant: Chelsea Kreiner (No Charity Designated)
