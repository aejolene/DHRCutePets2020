title: Minnie (Minerva)
caption: Minnie (Minerva) is a 4 month old Great Dane who absolutely loves to wage war on the gnomes in the house! She doesn't know how big she is because her big brother is so big, so she still thinks she is a lap dog even though she is almost 60 lbs.! Minnie would like donations to go to a charity that seeks to save dogs from bad home situations and find them loving forever homes, so that all dogs get a chance to have as much fun chasing toys as she does!
entrant: Chelsea Blake
charity: Dogs Deserve Better, Inc.
