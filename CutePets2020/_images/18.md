title: Henry's Day on the James
caption: Despite his middle age, Henry still struggles with his awkward smile.  But considering he spent the first year of his life homeless on the streets of Richmond - often tied up under bridges - and the second year living at animal control - thought to be unadoptable when paired with his identical brother - Henry now has a lot to smile about.  Adopted into a loving family in December 2016 from Richmond Animal Care & Control, Henry is a vegetarian that enjoys short walks and long naps.
