title: Uhh.. Bob, the fish. I guess?
caption: I haven't named them and they are surprisingly hard to take pictures of.  So this is the one decent picture of the one I'm now calling Bob.  They have these little whisker things that they can move and sometimes will touch each other with in a very cute way but anytime I approach the glass they zoom to the back of the tank.  I probably don't have their consent to share this, sorry Bob.
