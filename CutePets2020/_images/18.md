title: Dukie-Duke
caption: This distinguished animal was adopted from RACC almost 3 years ago.  Due to natural selection, he thrives in a couch environment.  He is cuddly, lazy, and ecstatic about teleworking.  90% of the time, he is a glorified armrest.  Favorite activities include long walks at Hollywood Cemetery, chasing his dog cousins, and tearing up paper/books (He is never alone with DHR files). Submitted by Carolyn Zemanian.
