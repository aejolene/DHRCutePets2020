title: "Filbert"
caption: You may think this bow-tie is pure fashion, but it's not. Filbert, aka Jingle Dingus, is an ex-feral who will NOT be indoored. So he gets to wear accessories to warn the innocent birds and animals. Submitted by Jolene, who wouldn't want to appear improper by soliciting votes in her own contest.
