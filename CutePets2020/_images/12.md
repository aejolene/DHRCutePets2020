title: Freddy
caption: Freddy is a rescue Great Dane who had a ruff start to life and was found starving with significant signs of abuse. His new home makes sure that he has all the food that he could (healthily) want, plenty of treats, and lots of birthday parties! His favorite pastime is snuggling on the couch with his mom and his favorite purple blanket. If Freddy wins, the donations will go to a charity to help dogs like him escape abusive home situations and find loving fur-ever homes.
entrant: Chelsea Blake
charity: Dogs Deserve Better, Inc.
