title: Poor Bella
caption: Bella started out as a very cute pup. Really, she did. As she grew it became evident that her heritage was somewhat, how to say this, not the best. She seems to have gotten all the worst characteristics of her ancestors. We love her anyway. But... She is very self-conscious about her extreme underbite. This is a rare photo of her smiling at me, back when she used to smile. She doesn't anymore. It seems some of the other dogs at the park have been mean to her and called her names like huckleberry hound or mongrel meat grinder. This kind of bullying would lead an intelligent dog to extreme depression. Fortunately Bella is not intelligent either. She has stopped smiling however just to get the other dogs to back off. I think if she were to win this challenge she might feel enough confidence to go to dog school (grades K-9) and get her diploma and maybe get a little smarter. Then perhaps we could work on a makeover, maybe get some braces (Invisaligns). One day she'll be able go to the park with her head raised high and her beautiful smile stunning the other mutts. She really needs to win this one.
