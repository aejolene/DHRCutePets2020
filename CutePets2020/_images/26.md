title: Henry Leaving Home?!
caption: Since his loss in the so-called (and highly questionable) "Cute Pets" contest last year, Henry has been threatening, with hat on and bags packed, to leave home to start a new life where his rugged good looks can be appreciated.  Please assure Henry with your vote that he is truly wonderful and would be greatly missed if he left.
