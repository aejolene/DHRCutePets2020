title: Freddy and Nessie
caption: This is Freddy and his friend Nessie! Nessie has historically been very shy, but since meeting Freddy she has had the courage to come out more often! So far she will only come out with her trusted Great Dane to accompany her, but hopefully soon she will have enough courage to go out on her own! Submitted by Chelsea Blake.
