title: Ready for the Holiday!
caption: Look at how cute I am? Despite my enthusiasm for the holiday season, I have been banned from attending the DHR happy hour! How fair is that?  I would love to personally wish everyone a happy holiday but my mean mom says NO! I've been crying ever since she broke the news and am trying to think of ways to retaliate. Of course, there are the "tried and true" methods that always get under her skin, but I could use a few new ideas! My mom always says "the more the merrier" but she must not really mean it!
