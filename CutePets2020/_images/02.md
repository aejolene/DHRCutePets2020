title: 02 Pity Vote for an Old Pitty?
caption: Duke is a longtime participant in this contest.  He's almost 13 now.  He has a perpetual old man cough.  He snores.  We think he had a stroke, and now he sags to the left.  He's at least three-quarters deaf (that's actually an advantage when you live with a baby).  We still love him and think his snowy face is very cute.  Duke hopes that the rest of DHR feels the same!
