title: Her last meal
caption: This is Bitty. She is 13 now. Due to hard times all we can afford to feed her now is one little piece of lettuce per day. She barely has strength to handle that, much less catch mice or fend for herself. I think the end is near. If she could win this contest it would mean a lot to her and to my kids (who are the reason we're in this predicament - but that's another sad story). She needs your vote to survive. Without your support I doubt she'll make it to Christmas. Please vote for Bitty. Her life is in your hands.
