          <h2>02 Pity Vote for an Old Pitty?</h2>
          <p>Duke is a longtime participant in this contest.  He's almost 13 now.  He has a perpetual old man cough.  He snores.  We think he had a stroke, and now he sags to the left.  He's at least three-quarters deaf (that's actually an advantage when you live with a baby).  We still love him and think his snowy face is very cute.  Duke hopes that the rest of DHR feels the same!</p>

          <h2>03 Enjoying Retirement!</h2>
          <p>After many years of competition and unrealized dreams of cuteness, Henry has decided to sit this one out and enjoy a life of leisure, relaxing on the couch and watching cat videos.  I'll say that he seems a little sad not to have ever been named "DHR's Cutest!", but he's a "tough" pittie from the streets of Richmond and would never admit that he has a soft side.  Could this year be different??</p>

          <p>My two children, pumpkin and peanut! They were both racing greyhounds in Florida and West VA respectively and are enjoying their lazy retirement here in RVA. We rescued them from an agency called James River Greyhound! Pumpkin is 9 years old and Peanut is 6; they both retired at 3 years old and we have had them ever since. Their favorite activities include laying down, eating, and laying down some more.</p>

He was only a couple of days old and barely had his eyes opened.  Now he is the alpha cat in the house, thinks he's human sometimes, gets away with things the others don't (last cat syndrome) and loves to pose for pictures.</p>

          <p>My name is Magnolia.  But, everyone calls me Maggie.  Rod Stewart fans call me Maggie May.  For some reason, whenever I settle into a nap, they start singing at me to "Wake up Maggie."  Very annoying!  When you come to visit me I will bring you all of my special toys and we can play fetch.  If you sit in one of my favorite chairs, I will climb up on the back, sit on your shoulder and give you kisses on your ear.  I do Wuv U!</p>

          <h2>11 Dishwasher Dog</h2>
          <p>So, I have a bad habit of eating mushrooms in my yard and on the side of the road...anywhere really. And because of that my owners have had to spend about a billion dollars in vet bills. Now, I am on a special diet with supplements, probiotics, clay powder and sometimes acupuncture because I ruined my GI tract with the toxic mushrooms. Something about helping my gut microbiome. The only treats I get are apple slices and I have lost like 8 pounds. I am always hungry. When no one is looking, I try to lick the dishes in the dishwasher. My mom looks the other way, but my dad gets upset. I try to do it quickly when no one is looking. But I have to admit the bits of food off the dishes are nothing compared to the mushrooms. If I win, maybe it could help pay for me to go to a doggie mushroom detox center?</p>
