          <h2>Bunz</h2>
          <p>This is Basil, but we just call her Bunz. In this image she is about to jump out of her cage after using her litter box. She is SO good about that! She loves to race through the house at top speed, then flop down on an air conditioning vent to cool off. Loves potato chips, but they bother her stomach, so is happy with carrots, leafy greens, apples and blueberries. Very cuddly, but when annoyed thumps her back foot at you. Mischievous acts include eating house plants and chewing on computer cords and baseboards. Bunz wants to be friends with all the cats she meets but they are afraid of her. How could anything be afraid of something so cute. Bunz appreciates your vote!!</p>

          <h2>Poor Bella</h2>
          <p>Bella started out as a very cute pup. Really, she did. As she grew it became evident that her heritage was somewhat, how to say this, not the best. She seems to have gotten all the worst characteristics of her ancestors. We love her anyway. But... She is very self-conscious about her extreme underbite. This is a rare photo of her smiling at me, back when she used to smile. She doesn't anymore. It seems some of the other dogs at the park have been mean to her and called her names like huckleberry hound or mongrel meat grinder. This kind of bullying would lead an intelligent dog to extreme depression. Fortunately Bella is not intelligent either. She has stopped smiling however just to get the other dogs to back off. I think if she were to win this challenge she might feel enough confidence to go to dog school (grades K-9) and get her diploma and maybe get a little smarter. Then perhaps we could work on a makeover, maybe get some braces (Invisaligns). One day she'll be able go to the park with her head raised high and her beautiful smile stunning the other mutts. She really needs to win this one.</p>

          <h2>Freddy</h2>
          <p>Freddy is a rescue Great Dane who had a ruff start to life and was found starving with significant signs of abuse. His new home makes sure that he has all the food that he could (healthily) want, plenty of treats, and lots of birthday parties! His favorite pastime is snuggling on the couch with his mom and his favorite purple blanket. If Freddy wins, the donations will go to a charity to help dogs like him escape abusive home situations and find loving fur-ever homes.</p>

She doesn't know how big she is because her big brother is so big, so she still thinks she is a lap dog even though she is almost 60 lbs.! Minnie would like donations to go to a charity that seeks to save dogs from bad home situations and find them loving forever homes, so that all dogs get a chance to have as much fun chasing toys as she does!</p>

          <p>Despite his middle age, Henry still struggles with his awkward smile.  But considering he spent the first year of his life homeless on the streets of Richmond - often tied up under bridges - and the second year living at animal control - thought to be unadoptable when paired with his identical brother - Henry now has a lot to smile about.  Adopted into a loving family in December 2016 from Richmond Animal Care & Control, Henry is a vegetarian that enjoys short walks and long naps.</p>

          <h2>Ellie</h2>
          <p>Ellie is a sweet grouch who is both over confident and very clumsy. She loves to supervise a WFH day but only if she can stand on all the papers you need. She is unfazed by thunder but terrified every time the freezer makes ice. Lest you think she has always lived in the lap of luxury, she reportedly spent a week outside in the snow in Upstate New York before she came to live with us and every winter I am convinced she has not forgotten that fact.</p>
